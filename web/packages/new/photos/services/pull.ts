/**
 * Called during a full remote pull, before doing the files pull.
 *
 * [Note: Remote pull]
 *
 * There are two types of remote pulls we perform:
 *
 * - A "files" pull: Updating our local state with the latest collections,
 *   collection files, and trash from remote.
 *
 * - A "full" pull, which includes the files pull, and more.
 *
 * The full pull is performed by the gallery page, in the following sequence:
 *
 * 1. {@link prePullFiles}
 * 2. {@link pullFiles}
 * 3. {@link postPullFiles}.
 *
 * The full pull is performed in the following cases:
 *
 * - On the gallery page load (for both web and desktop).
 * - Every 5 minutes thereafter (while the user is on the gallery page).
 * - Each time the desktop app gains focus.
 * - When the file viewer is closed after performing some operation.
 *
 * In some other cases, where we know that only specific collection or file
 * state needs to be pulled, step 2 ({@link pullFiles}) is performed
 * independently. For example, after deduping files, or updating the metadata of
 * a file. See also: [Note: Full remote pull vs files pull]
